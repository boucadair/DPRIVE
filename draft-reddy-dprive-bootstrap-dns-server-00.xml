    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise, secure
      home and wall-gardened networks to protect endpoints, some of these
      security services act on DNS requests from endpoints. However, if the
      endpoints are configured to use public DNS-over-(D)TLS <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> <xref target="RFC8094"></xref> or
      DNS-over-HTTPS <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> servers, network security
      services in the local network cannot act on DNS requests from the
      endpoints. In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network
      security services can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing
      packets to destination port 853, and by identifying the domains offering
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic is blocked by dropping
      outgoing packets to these domains. If the endpoint has enabled strict
      privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the
      network security service blocks the traffic to the public DNS server,
      DNS service is not available to the endpoint and ultimately the endpoint
      cannot access Internet. If the endpoint has enabled opportunistic
      privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the
      network security service blocks traffic to the public DNS server, the
      endpoint will either fallback to an encrypted connection without
      authenticating the DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided
      by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and cannot exchange
      encrypted DNS messages. This can compromise the endpoint security and
      privacy, some of the possible security threats are listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.</t>

          <t>If IoT devices are configured to use public DNS-over-(D)TLS or
          DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy enforcement point in the
          local network is programmed using a Manufacturer Usage Description
          (MUD) file <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref> by the MUD
          manager to only allow intented communications to and from the IoT
          devices, the policy enforcement point cannot enforce the Network
          Access Control List rules based on domain names (Section 8 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The network security service cannot block the endpoint from
          accessing malicious domains. Attacks like DNS cache poisoning can
          lead the user to visit malicious website to inject malware on the
          endpoint. For instance, malwares like DNSChanger can modify the
          endpoint's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers
          which then injected its own advertising into Web pages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The working groups DPRIVE and DoH have not defined a automated
      mechanism to securely bootstrap the endpoints to discover and
      authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers in the local
      network. Some clients have hard-coded specific public DNS servers (such
      as Mozilla using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS server). If endpoints
      continue to use hard-coded public DNS servers, this has a risk of
      relying on few centralized DNS services. Further, Content Delivery
      Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may lose the ability to
      direct end-user traffic to a nearby cluster in cases where a DNS service
      is being used that is not affiliated with the local network and which
      does not send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information to the CDN's DNS
      authorities (<xref target="CDN"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The draft proposes a mechanism to automatically bootstrap the
      endpoints to discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network.</t>

    <section anchor="solution" title="Solution overview">
      <t>The following steps discuss the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
      IoT devices with local network's CA certificates and DNS server
      certificate. <list style="symbols">
          <t>The IoT device can use Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
          Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref> to
          automatically bootstrap the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer
          provisioned X.509 certificate, in combination with a registrar
          provided by the local network and IoT device manufacturer's
          authorizing service (MASA). <list style="numbers">
              <t>The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
              IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate. The IoT device
              can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via the
              registrar. The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
              includes the local network's CA public key.</t>

              <t>The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
              manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
              stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
              connection to the registrar.</t>

              <t>The IoT device requests the full Enrollment over Secure
              Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"></xref> distribution of
              current CA certificates (Section 5.9.1 in <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>) from the
              registrar operating as a BRSKI-EST server. The IoT device uses
              the Explicit Trust Anchor database to authenticate the DNS
              server offered by the local network.</t>

              <t>TBD: The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates <xref
              target="RFC8295"></xref> from the BRSKI-EST server. The
              certificate provisioned to the DNS server in the local network
              will be treated as a End-Entity certificate. The key usage
              extension <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> can be used to restrict
              the use of the DNS server certificate to authenticate the DNS
              server, a new bit will be added to the KeyUsage type to identify
              the DNS server certificate.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The above steps can also be used by broadband gateways acting as DNS
      forwarders to discover and authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the access networks.</t>

      <t>The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
      endpoint with the local network's CA certificates and DNS server
      certificate. <list style="numbers">
          <t>The endpoint authenticates to the local network and establishes
          provisional TLS connection with the registrar operating as the
          BRSKI-EST server. The endpoint discovers registrar using DNS-based
          Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"></xref>. </t>

          <t>The endpoint uses Salted Challenge Response Authentication
          Mechanism (SCRAM) <xref target="RFC7804"></xref> to perform mutual
          authentication with the discovered BRSKI-EST server.</t>

          <t>If the BRSKI-EST server authentication is successful, the
          endpoint requests the full EST distribution of current CA
          certificates and validates the provisional TLS connection to the
          BRSKI-EST server. If the BRSKI-EST server certificate cannot be
          verified using the CA certifates downloaded, the TLS connection is
          immediately discarded and the endpoint abandons the attempt to
          bootstrap from the BRSKI-EST server and discards the CA certificates
          conveyed by the EST server. The endpoint uses the Explicit Trust
          Anchor database to authenticate the DNS server offered by the local
          network. </t>

          <t>TBD: The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates <xref
          target="RFC8295"></xref> from the BRSKI-EST server. The certificate
          provisioned to the DNS server in the local network will be treated
          as a End-Entity certificate. The key usage extension can be used to
          restrict the use of the DNS server certificate to authenticate the
          DNS server, a new bit will be added to the KeyUsage type to identify
          the DNS server certificate. </t>

    <section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery procedure">
      <t>A DNS client can discover the DNS server in the local network
      supporting DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols by
      using the following discovery mechanism:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The DNS client uses DHCP to discover the authentication domain
          name for the DNS server, as specified in <xref

          <t>The DNS client then use S-NAPTR <xref target="RFC3958"></xref>
          lookup to learn the protocols DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and
          DNS-over-HTTPS supported by the DNS server and the DNS privacy
          protocol preferred by the DNS server administrators, as specified in
          <xref target="serviceT"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server,
          the server present its certificate and the client validates the
          server certificate using the Explicit Trust Anchor database. </t>

          certificates".</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order to allow for certifcate authentication between a DNS client
