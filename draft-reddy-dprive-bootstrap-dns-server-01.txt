1.  Introduction

   Various network security services are provided by Enterprise, secure
   home and wall-gardened networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. hosts,
   IoT devices).  Some of these security services act on DNS requests
   from endpoints.  However, if an endpoint is configured to use public
   DNS-over-(D)TLS [RFC7858] [RFC8094] or DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484]
   servers, network security services in the local network cannot act
   efficiently on DNS requests from the endpoints.  In order to act on
   DNS requests from endpoints, network security services can block DNS-
   over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing packets to destination port
   853, and by identifying the domains offering DNS-over-HTTPS servers,
   DNS-over-HTTPS traffic can be blocked by dropping outgoing packets to
   these domains.  If the endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile
   (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), and the network security service blocks the
   traffic to the public DNS server, DNS service is not available to the
   endpoint and ultimately the endpoint cannot access Internet.  If the
   endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile (Section 5 of
   [RFC8310]), and the network security service blocks traffic to the
   public DNS server, the endpoint will either fallback to an encrypted

   connection without authenticating the DNS-over-(D)TLS server provided
   by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and cannot
   exchange encrypted DNS messages.  This can compromise the endpoint
   security and privacy; some of the potential security threats are
   listed below:

   o  Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.

   o  If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use public
      DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy
      enforcement point in the local network is programmed using a
      Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) file [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] by
      a MUD manager to only allow intented communications to and from
      the IoT device, the policy enforcement point cannot enforce the
      Network Access Control List rules based on domain names (Section 8
      of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]).

   o  The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
      accessing malicious domains.  Attacks like DNS cache poisoning can
      lead the user to visit malicious website to inject malware on the
      endpoint.  For instance, malwares like DNSChanger can modify the
      endpoint's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers
      which then injected its own advertising into Web pages.

   The DPRIVE and DoH working groups have not defined an automated
   mechanism to securely bootstrap the endpoints to discover and
   authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers in the local
   network.  Some clients have pre-configured specific public DNS
   servers (such as Mozilla using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS server).
   If endpoints continue to use hard-coded public DNS servers, this has
   a risk of relying on few centralized DNS services.  Content Delivery
   Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may lose the ability to
   direct end-user traffic to a nearby cluster in cases where a DNS
   service is being used that is not affiliated with the local network
   and which does not send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information to the
   CDN's DNS authorities [CDN].  If a local DNS server is not used for
   DNS resolution, "Split DNS" [RFC2775] to use the special internal-
   only domain names in enterprise networks will not work, and ".local"
   and "home.arpa" names cannot be locally resolved in home networks.

   The document proposes a mechanism to automatically bootstrap the
   endpoints to discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-
   over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network.  The overall
   procedure can be structured into the following steps:

   o  Bootstrapping phase (Section 3 and Section 4) is meant to
      automatically bootstrap endpoints with local network's CA
      certificates and DNS server certificate.



Reddy, et al.           Expires September 6, 2019               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery              March 2019


   o  Discovery phase (Section 5) is meant to discover the privacy-
      enabling protocols supported by the DNS server and usable DNS
      server IP addresses and port numbers.

   o  Connection handshake and service invocation: The DNS client
      initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server learned in the
      discovery phase.  Furthermore, DNS client uses the credentials
      discovered during the bootstrapping phase to validate the server
      certificate.

   Note: The strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in
   [RFC8310] only applies to DNS-over-(D)TLS protocols, there has been
   no such distinction made for DNS-over-HTTPS protocol.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   (D)TLS is used for statements that apply to both Transport Layer
   Security [RFC8446] and Datagram Transport Layer Security [RFC6347].
   Specific terms are used for any statement that applies to either
   protocol alone.

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC8499].

3.  Bootstrapping IoT Devices and CPE

   The following steps discuss the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   IoT devices with local network's CA certificates and DNS server
   certificate.  The below steps can also be used by CPE acting as DNS
   forwarders to discover and authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-
   HTTPS servers provided by the access networks.

   o  Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed
      in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] provides a solution for
      secure automated bootstrap of devices.  BRSKI specifies means to
      provision credentials on devices to be used to operationally
      access networks.  In addition, BRSKI provides an automated
      mechanism for the bootstrap distribution of CA certificates from
      the EST server.  The IoT device can use BRSKI discussed in
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] to automatically bootstrap
      the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509
      certificate, in combination with a registrar provided by the local
      network and IoT device manufacturer's authorizing service (MASA).

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery              March 2019


      1.  The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
          IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate.  The IoT
          device can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via
          the registrar.  The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
          includes the local network's CA public key.

      2.  The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
          manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
          stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
          connection to the registrar.

      3.  The IoT device requests the full Enrollment over Secure
          Transport (EST) [RFC7030] distribution of current CA
          certificates (Section 5.9.1 in
          [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]) from the registrar
          operating as a BRSKI-EST server.  The IoT devices stores the
          CA certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database entries.
          The IoT device uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database to
          validate the DNS server certificate.

      4.  TBD: The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates
          [RFC8295] from the BRSKI-EST server.  The certificate
          provisioned to the DNS server in the local network will be
          treated as a End-Entity certificate.  The IoT device needs to
          identify the End-Entity certificate provisioned to the DNS
          server.  The key usage extension [RFC5280] can be used to
          restrict the use of the End-Entity certificate to authenticate
          the DNS server, a new bit will be added to the KeyUsage type
          to identify the DNS server certificate.

4.  Bootstrapping Endpoint Devices

   The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   an endpoint with the local network's CA certificates and DNS server
   certificate:

   1.  The endpoint authenticates to the local network and establishes
       provisional TLS connection with the registrar operating as the
       BRSKI-EST server.  The endpoint discovers registrar using DNS-
       based Service Discovery [RFC6763].

   2.  The endpoint uses Salted Challenge Response Authentication
       Mechanism (SCRAM) [RFC7804] to perform mutual authentication with
       the discovered BRSKI-EST server.  SCRAM provides a more robust
       authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by
       Transport Layer Security (TLS).

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery              March 2019


   3.  If the BRSKI-EST server authentication is successful, the
       endpoint requests the full EST distribution of current CA
       certificates and validates the provisional TLS connection to the
       BRSKI-EST server.  If the BRSKI-EST server certificate cannot be
       verified using the CA certificates downloaded, the TLS connection
       is immediately discarded and the endpoint abandons the attempt to
       bootstrap from the BRSKI-EST server and discards the CA
       certificates conveyed by the BRSKI-EST server.  The endpoint
       stores the CA certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database
       entries.  The endpoint uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database to
       validate the DNS server certificate.  The endpoint needs to
       perform SCRAM authentication the first time it connects BRSKI-EST
       server.  On subsequent connections to the BRSKI-EST server, the
       endpoint can validate the BRSKI-EST server certificate using the
       Explicit Trust Anchor database.

   4.  TBD: The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates [RFC8295]
       from the BRSKI-EST server.  The certificate provisioned to the
       DNS server in the local network will be treated as a End-Entity
       certificate.  The endpoint needs to identify the End-Entity
       certificate provisioned to the DNS server.  The key usage
       extension [RFC5280] can be used to restrict the use of the End-
       Entity certificate to authenticate the DNS server, a new bit will
       be added to the KeyUsage type to identify the DNS server
       certificate.

5.  Discovery Procedure

   A DNS client discovers the DNS server in the local network supporting
   DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols by using the
   following discovery mechanism:

   o  The DNS client retrieves the authentication domain name for the
      DNS server from the DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName
      entry in the DNS server certificate.

   o  The DNS client then uses the authentication domain name for
      S-NAPTR [RFC3958] lookup to learn the protocols DNS-over-TLS, DNS-
      over-DTLS, and DNS-over-HTTPS supported by the DNS server and the
      DNS privacy protocol preferred by the DNS server administrators,
      as specified in Section 5.1 and Section 8.1.  This specification
      adds a SRV service label "domain-s" for privacy-enabling DNS
      servers.  In the example below, for authentication domain name
      'example.net', the resolution algorithm will result in the
      privacy-enabling protocols supported by the DNS server and usable
      DNS server IP addresses and port numbers.

   o  If DNS-over-HTTPS protocol is supported by the DNS server, the DNS
      client queries for the URI resource record type [RFC7553] to use
      the https URI scheme (Section 3 of [RFC8484]).  In the example
      below, for authentication domain name 'example.net' and the URL
      for resolution is https://example.net/dns-query.  The following
      URI resource records could be made available:

      $ORIGIN example.net.
      _domain-s._tcp    IN URI 10 1 "https://example.net/dns-query"

                                 Figure 2

5.1.  Resolution

   Once the DNS client has retrieved the authentication domain name for
   the DNS server, an S-NAPTR lookup with 'DPRIVE' application service
   and the desired protocol tag is made to obtain information necessary
   to securely connect to the DNS server.  The S-NAPTR lookup is
   performed using an untrusted recursive DNS resolver from an untrusted
   source (such as DHCP).

   This specification defines "DPRIVE" as an application service tag
   (Section 8.1.1) and "dns.tls" (Section 8.1.2), "dns.dtls"
   (Section 8.1.3), and "dns.https" (Section 8.1.4) as application
   protocol tags.

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery              March 2019


   If no DNS-specific S-NAPTR records can be retrieved, the discovery
   procedure fails for this authentication domain name.  However, before
   retrying a lookup that has failed, a DNS client MUST wait a time
   period that is appropriate for the encountered error (e.g., NXDOMAIN,
   timeout, etc.).

6.  Connection handshake and service invocation

   The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server, the
   server presents its certificate in ServerHello message, and the DNS
   client matches the DNS server certificate downloaded in step 4 in
   Section 3 and Section 4 with the certificate provided by the DNS
   server in (D)TLS handshake.  If the match is successful, the DNS
   client validates the server certificate using the Explicit Trust
   Anchor database entries downloaded in step 3 in Section 3 and
   Section 4.

   If the match is successful and server certificate is successfully
   validated, the client continues with the connection as normal.
   Otherwise, the client MUST treat the server certificate validation
   failure as a non-recoverable error.  If the DNS client cannot reach
   or establish an authenticated and encrypted connection with the
   privacy-enabling DNS server provided by the local network, the DNS
   client can fallback to the privacy-enabling public DNS server.

7.  Security Considerations

   The bootstrapping procedure to discover and authenticate DNS-
   over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Servers MUST be enabled by the
   endpoint in a trusted network (e.g.  Enterprise, Secure home
   networks) and disabled in a untrusted network (e.g. public WiFi
   network), similar to the way VPN connection from the endpoint to a
   VPN gateway is disconnected in a trusted network and VPN connection
   is established in a untrusted network.

   If the endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
   security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public
   DNS server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified.  The user
   has a choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the
   network, the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DNS-
   over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server discovered in the network
   instead of downgrading to opportunistic privacy profile.

   The primary attacks against the methods described in Section 5 are
   the ones that would lead to impersonation of a DNS server and
   spoofing the DNS response to indicate that the DNS server does not
   support any privacy-enabling protocols.  To protect against DNS-
   vectored attacks, secured DNS (DNSSEC) can be used to ensure the

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery              March 2019


   validity of the DNS records received.  The explicit trust anchor
   database entries downloaded in step 3 in Section 3 and Section 4 can
   be used by the endpoint to validate the DNSSEC signature.
   Impersonation of the DNS server is prevented by validating the
   certificate presented by the DNS server.  If the BRSKI-EST server
   conveys the DNS server certificate, but the S-NAPTR lookup indicates
   that the DNS server does not support any privacy-enabling protocols,
   the client can detect the DNS response is spoofed.

   Security considerations in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   and [RFC7804] need to be taken into consideration.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the SRV service name of "domain-s" for
   DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS.

8.1.  Application Service & Application Protocol Tags
