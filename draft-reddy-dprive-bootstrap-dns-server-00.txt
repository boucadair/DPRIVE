1.  Introduction

   Various network security services are provided by Enterprise, secure
   home and wall-gardened networks to protect endpoints, some of these
   security services act on DNS requests from endpoints.  However, if
   the endpoints are configured to use public DNS-over-(D)TLS [RFC7858]
   [RFC8094] or DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484] servers, network security
   services in the local network cannot act on DNS requests from the
   endpoints.  In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network
   security services can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping
   outgoing packets to destination port 853, and by identifying the
   domains offering DNS-over-HTTPS servers, DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic is
   blocked by dropping outgoing packets to these domains.  If the
   endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of [RFC8310]),
   and the network security service blocks the traffic to the public DNS
   server, DNS service is not available to the endpoint and ultimately
   the endpoint cannot access Internet.  If the endpoint has enabled

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery           February 2019


   opportunistic privacy profile (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), and the
   network security service blocks traffic to the public DNS server, the
   endpoint will either fallback to an encrypted connection without
   authenticating the DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers
   provided by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and
   cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.  This can compromise the
   endpoint security and privacy, some of the possible security threats
   are listed below:

   o  Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.

   o  If IoT devices are configured to use public DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy enforcement point in the
      local network is programmed using a Manufacturer Usage Description
      (MUD) file [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] by the MUD manager to only allow
      intented communications to and from the IoT devices, the policy
      enforcement point cannot enforce the Network Access Control List
      rules based on domain names (Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]).

   o  The network security service cannot block the endpoint from
      accessing malicious domains.  Attacks like DNS cache poisoning can
      lead the user to visit malicious website to inject malware on the
      endpoint.  For instance, malwares like DNSChanger can modify the
      endpoint's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers
      which then injected its own advertising into Web pages.

   The working groups DPRIVE and DoH have not defined a automated
   mechanism to securely bootstrap the endpoints to discover and
   authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers in the local
   network.  Some clients have hard-coded specific public DNS servers
   (such as Mozilla using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS server).  If
   endpoints continue to use hard-coded public DNS servers, this has a
   risk of relying on few centralized DNS services.  Further, Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may lose the
   ability to direct end-user traffic to a nearby cluster in cases where
   a DNS service is being used that is not affiliated with the local
   network and which does not send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS)
   information to the CDN's DNS authorities [CDN].

   The draft proposes a mechanism to automatically bootstrap the
   endpoints to discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-
   over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network.

2.  Bootstrapping IoT devices and broadband gateways

   The following steps discuss the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   IoT devices with local network's CA certificates and DNS server
   certificate.  The above steps can also be used by broadband gateways



Reddy, et al.            Expires August 25, 2019                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery           February 2019


   acting as DNS forwarders to discover and authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS
   and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the access networks.

   o  The IoT device can use Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
      Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed in
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] to automatically bootstrap
      the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509
      certificate, in combination with a registrar provided by the local
      network and IoT device manufacturer's authorizing service (MASA).

      1.  The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
          IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate.  The IoT
          device can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via
          the registrar.  The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
          includes the local network's CA public key.

      2.  The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
          manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
          stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
          connection to the registrar.

      3.  The IoT device requests the full Enrollment over Secure
          Transport (EST) [RFC7030] distribution of current CA
          certificates (Section 5.9.1 in
          [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]) from the registrar
          operating as a BRSKI-EST server.  The IoT device uses the
          Explicit Trust Anchor database to authenticate the DNS server
          offered by the local network.

      4.  TBD: The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates
          [RFC8295] from the BRSKI-EST server.  The certificate
          provisioned to the DNS server in the local network will be
          treated as a End-Entity certificate.  The IoT device needs to
          identify the End-Entity certificate is provisioned to the DNS
          server, the key usage extension [RFC5280] can be used to
          restrict the use of the End-Entity certificate to authenticate
          the DNS server, a new bit will be added to the KeyUsage type
          to identify the DNS server certificate.

3.  Bootstrapping endpoint devices

   The following steps explain the mechanism to automatically bootstrap
   endpoint with the local network's CA certificates and DNS server
   certificate.

   1.  The endpoint authenticates to the local network and establishes
       provisional TLS connection with the registrar operating as the




Reddy, et al.            Expires August 25, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          DoT/DoH server discovery           February 2019


       BRSKI-EST server.  The endpoint discovers registrar using DNS-
       based Service Discovery [RFC6763].

   2.  The endpoint uses Salted Challenge Response Authentication
       Mechanism (SCRAM) [RFC7804] to perform mutual authentication with
       the discovered BRSKI-EST server.

   3.  If the BRSKI-EST server authentication is successful, the
       endpoint requests the full EST distribution of current CA
       certificates and validates the provisional TLS connection to the
       BRSKI-EST server.  If the BRSKI-EST server certificate cannot be
       verified using the CA certifates downloaded, the TLS connection
       is immediately discarded and the endpoint abandons the attempt to
       bootstrap from the BRSKI-EST server and discards the CA
       certificates conveyed by the EST server.  The endpoint uses the
       Explicit Trust Anchor database to authenticate the DNS server
       offered by the local network.

   4.  TBD: The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates [RFC8295]
       from the BRSKI-EST server.  The certificate provisioned to the
       DNS server in the local network will be treated as a End-Entity
       certificate.  The endpoint needs to identify the End-Entity
       certificate is provisioned to the DNS server, the key usage
       extension [RFC5280] can be used to restrict the use of the End-
       Entity certificate to authenticate the DNS server, a new bit will
       be added to the KeyUsage type to identify the DNS server
       certificate.

4.  Discovery procedure

   A DNS client can discover the DNS server in the local network
   supporting DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols
   by using the following discovery mechanism:

   o  The DNS client uses DHCP to discover the authentication domain
      name for the DNS server, as specified in Section 5.

   o  The DNS client then use S-NAPTR [RFC3958] lookup to learn the
      protocols DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-HTTPS supported
      by the DNS server and the DNS privacy protocol preferred by the
      DNS server administrators, as specified in Section 8.3.1.

   o  The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server, the
      server present its certificate and the client validates the server
      certificate using the Explicit Trust Anchor database.

5.  DHCP Options for DNS server discovery

   As reported in Section 1.7.2 of [RFC6125]:

      "few certification authorities issue server certificates based on
      IP addresses, but preliminary evidence indicates that such
      certificates are a very small percentage (less than 1%) of issued
      certificates".

   In order to allow for certifcate authentication between a DNS client
   and server while accommodating for the current best practices for
   issuing certificates, this document allows for configuring
   authentication domain name to clients.  This name can be used as a
   reference identifier for authentication purposes.

5.1.  DHCPv6 DNS Options

5.1.1.  Format of DNS Reference Identifier Option

   The DHCPv6 DNS option is used to configure a authentication domain
   name.  The format of this option is shown in Figure 1.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


             Figure 1: DHCPv6 DNS Reference Identifier option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  Option-code: OPTION_V6_AUTH_DOMAIN (TBA1, see Section 8.1)
   o  Option-length: Length of the authentication-domain-name field in
      octets.
   o  authentication-domain-name: A fully qualified domain name of the
      DNS server.  This field is formatted as specified in Section 8 of
      [RFC3315].

5.1.2.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   DHCP clients MAY request options OPTION_V6_AUTH_DOMAIN as defined in
   [RFC3315], Sections 17.1.1, 18.1.1, 18.1.3, 18.1.4, 18.1.5, and 22.7.
   As a convenience to the reader, it is mentioned here that the DHCP

   client includes the requested option code in the Option Request
   Option.

   If the DHCP client receives more than one instance of
   OPTION_V6_AUTH_DOMAIN option, it MUST use only the first instance of
   that option.

5.2.  DHCPv4 DNS Options

5.2.1.  Format of DNS Reference Identifier Option

   The DHCPv4 DNS option is used to configure a authentication domain
   name.  The format of this option is illustrated in Figure 2.

            Code  Length   authentication domain name
           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
           |TBA2 |  n  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...
           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

     The values s1, s2, s3, etc. represent the domain name labels in the
     domain name encoding.


             Figure 2: DHCPv4 DNS Reference Identifier option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 2 are as follows:

   o  Code: OPTION_V4_AUTH_DOMAIN (TBA2, see Section 8.2);
   o  Length: Includes the length of the authentication domain name
      field in octets; the maximum length is 255 octets.
   o  Authentication domain name: The domain name of the DNS server.
      This field is formatted as specified in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

5.2.2.  DHCPv4 Client Behavior

   To discover a authentication domain name, the DHCPv4 client MUST
   include OPTION_V4_AUTH_DOMAIN in a Parameter Request List Option
   [RFC2132].

   If the DHCP client receives more than one instance of
   OPTION_V4_AUTH_DOMAIN option, it MUST use only the first instance of
   that option.  The content of OPTION_V4_AUTH_DOMAIN is used as
   reference identifier for authentication purposes.

6.  Resolution

   Once the DNS client has retrieved the authentication domain name for
   the DNS server, an S-NAPTR lookup with 'DPRIVE' application service
   and the desired protocol tag is made to obtain information necessary
   to securely connect to the DNS server.

   This specification defines "DPRIVE" as an application service tag
   (Section 8.3.1) and "dns.tls" (Section 8.3.2), "dns.dtls"
   (Section 8.3.3), and "dns.https" (Section 8.3.4) as application
   protocol tags.

   If no DNS-specific S-NAPTR records can be retrieved, the discovery
   procedure fails for this authentication domain name.  However, before
   retrying a lookup that has failed, a DNS client MUST wait a time
   period that is appropriate for the encountered error (e.g., NXDOMAIN,
   timeout, etc.).

7.  Security Considerations

   The primary attack against the methods described in Section 4 is one
   that would lead to impersonation of a DNS server.  An attacker could
   attempt to compromise the DHCP discovery and S-NAPTR resolution.  The
   attack is prevented by validating the certificate presented by the
   DNS server.

   Security considerations in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   and [RFC7804] need to be taken into consideration.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following new DHCPv6 Option Code in
   the registry maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   dhcpv6-parameters:
